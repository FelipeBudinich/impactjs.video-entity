Video Player Entity for ImpactJs
http://impactjs.com/

This is a simple entity that will create a video tag and then place the video within the impact 

canvas.  This doesn't check for if it can play currently, as I was only targeting mp4 playing.

The set up is pretty stadard for any impact entity.
